<h1 align="center"> Unspaghettify Kart 64 </h1>

This repo seeks to refurbish the fossil from computing antiquity that is mk64. This includes decluttering the code-base, fixing bugs, and adding fun features.  
View the projects [lore](https://n64decomp.github.io/mk64/lore.html)

## Contributing
* Place new features that effect gameplay behind a condition so they can be toggled on/off.
* A new segment for new standalone code files will be setup.
* Try to describe all your changes in your PR. PR commits should be very descriptive to help reverts and bug investigations.
* Test your changes that you haven't effected other gameplay elements in a negative way.
* Have fun!

## Decomp Readme

This work-in-progress decompilation of Mario Kart 64 pursues historical and educational elements within the game found via taking it apart and putting it back together. Inspiration to do so not only emanates from the game's hardware and technology but also its immensely positive effects on the cultures and families of nearly every nationality.

This repository does not contain assets. Compiling requires asset extraction from a prior copy of the game.

It supports and builds the following versions:

| ROM Output        | Revision| SHA-1 Checksum                           |
|-------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| mk64.us.z64       | USA     | 579c48e211ae952530ffc8738709f078d5dd215e |
| mk64.eu-1.0.z64   | EUR 1.0 | a729039453210b84f17019dda3f248d5888f7690 |
| mk64.eu-final.z64 | EUR 1.1 | f6b5f519dd57ea59e9f013cc64816e9d273b2329 |

## Progress

Total progress consists of all code segments together.

Game code progress consists of `main`, `ending` and `racing`.

## Quick Start

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
```
make -j
```

## Building

Build instructions located in the [API docs](https://n64decomp.github.io/mk64/compiling.html)  
See also, the comprehensive API and documentation which includes an overview of the code-base while also discussing significant concepts, features, and modding.

## Current State

The code-base may change significanty overtime as naming and documentation continues. The code-base is shiftable.

Some menu textures are compressed using a format called tkmk00. A byte-matching compressor/decompressor does not yet exist.
